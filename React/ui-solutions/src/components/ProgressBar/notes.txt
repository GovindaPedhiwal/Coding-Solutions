In order to do animation kind of stuff or changing width dynamically
it's recommended to use transform instead of width.

Note => In a page there can be multiple sections like header, container and footer and all are part of one frame so when any change happens
inside any container other containes also have to adjust so this is how painting happens. If change width of one container so other containers also have to adjust right.

width => Whenever any change happens in container it paint the complete page so other
elements also have to adjust accordingly which cause performance issues because it used only one frame for all blocks
transform = In case of using transform if any change happens then it only adjust the block
where changes happened so it creates another frame where this property being used and adjust over there
